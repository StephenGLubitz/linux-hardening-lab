A  project documenting the hardening of a Linux server for cybersecurity practice.
# Linux Hardening Lab

## 📌 Summary
This project demonstrates how I securely configured and hardened a Linux server from a clean installation.  
It covers essential security practices including user management, SSH hardening, firewall configuration, logging, and intrusion prevention.

## 🖥️ Environment
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (VM)
- VirtualBox / Proxmox (whichever you're using)
- Tools: `ufw`, `fail2ban`, `ssh-keygen`, `systemd`, `journalctl`

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create a secure non-root user  
- Configure SSH key authentication  
- Disable password-based SSH login  
- Harden the firewall  
- Set up automatic updates  
- Configure logging and log retention  
- Install and configure Fail2ban
